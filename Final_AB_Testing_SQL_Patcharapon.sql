-- 1. Data Quality Check

-- We are running an experiment at an item-level, which means all users who visit will see the same page, but the layout of different item pages may differ.
-- Compare this table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing.
-- Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?

-- Answer: No, we need the eventime

-- 2. Reformat the Data

-- Reformat the final_assignments_qa to look like the final_assignments table, filling in any missing values with a placeholder of the appropriate data type.

-- Check null 1
